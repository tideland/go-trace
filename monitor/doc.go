// Package monitor helps monitoring of Go applications. The stop watch part allows
// to measure the execution time and retrieve how often it is called, minimum,
// maximum, and average durations. Another one is the stay-set indicator allowing
// to increase and decrease values and retrieve count, maximum, minimum, and
// current value. This can help to control and manage limiters or pools.
