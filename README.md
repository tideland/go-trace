## Description

**Tideland Go Trace** helps running applications and servers.

* `crumbs` provides a flexible and convenient logging package with an exchangeable backend
* `failure` is a more powerful error management than the standard package
* `location` allows to retrieve current file and line, helpful for errors and logging
* `logging` is a more controllable logging with an exchangeable backend, e.g. syslog
* `monitor` allows to measure runtimes and monitor variables
* `stayset` provides to monitor stuff like parallel instances in different namespaces
* `stopwatch` allows to measure runtimes of code points in different namespaces

I hope you like it. ;)
